Background of Project:

The key area of this project is listing the reviews of Airbnb property in Venice, average, maximum and minimum prices of Airbnb according to room type and property type in Venice, Italy and comparing those with Dublin City. It consists calculation weekly host who has most property in Airbnb listing in Venice and finding the neighbourhood who has maximum property in Airbnb list for Venice and Dublin.

Learning:

Through the project I came across the actual usage of R language in statistical analysis and found it interesting and easy to demonstrate. Firstly I was using the loops and one liners to answer the analysis which was bit lengthy, so I explored the class tutorial and decided to use DPLYR library for answer questions which has summary function and filtration of data. I used function like select, filter, summarize and these made my work and easy and decreased my code.  Apart from I got hands on functions which explained me more the usability and again resulted in decreased of code and more understandable. 

Dataset OR Inputs:

For this analysis, Inside Airbnb(https://elearning.ait.ie/pluginfile.php/285443/mod_assign/intro/Assignment2a_Cities.csv) data is available for public use and visualization. The data set has 16 columns and 7864 rows.  Cleaning of this data is necessary as there are some missing value for one or more columns.
Most Important data sets has description of listing and header in txt format. apparently, I can say I am really lucky that i got a great data sets in which myself actually interested in. Inside Airbnb has scraped the data in such a way that it answers the question like how Airbnb is being used and the way it is affecting the neighbourhood in your locality.
